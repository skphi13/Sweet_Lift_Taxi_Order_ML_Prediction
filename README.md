# Sweet_Lift_Taxi_Order_ML_Prediction

## Introduction

Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.

## Data Description

- taxi.csv
- num_orders - number of orders

## Conclusion
- Data Analysis revealed hourly fluctuations in taxi orders, with seasonal patterns and variability across different times of day and days of the week.
- The best-performing model was the tuned Random Forest, with hyperparameters optimized for accuracy, achieving an RMSE of 46.73.
- The RMSE goal of 48 was successfully met, indicating the model's satisfactory predictive performance.
- Future improvements could include incorporating additional features (e.g., weather, holidays), testing advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM), and addressing outliers.
